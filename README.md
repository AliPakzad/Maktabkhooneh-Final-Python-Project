# Maktabkhooneh-Final-Python-Project

Write a program that uses webscraping to take the information of the first 300 cars of a desired brand (the name of the brand is given in the input) from the Truecar website and stores it in a desired database. Then builds a machine learning model that predicts the price of the car with its information(such as 'mileage', 'yearMake', 'numOfAccidents', 'numOfOwners', 'model', etc) as the input features.
